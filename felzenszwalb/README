Distance Transforms of Sampled Functions

The main program "dt.cpp" computes the standard distance transform of
a binary image.  The algorithm for computing the transform of a
sampled function is in "dt.h".

1) Type make to compile "dt".

2) Run "./dt input.pbm output.pgm" to compute the distance transform
of a binary image.  The input is a binary PBM image and the output is
a grayscale PGM image.  Note that the actual distance values are
scaled to fit in the [0-255] grayscale range.
